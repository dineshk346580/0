### Managed VPS Hosting
Scala Hosting excels with its managed VPS hosting, meaning they take care of server maintenance, security updates, and performance optimization.

SPanel includes all the essential features you'd expect, like email management, file management, and database management, but it also includes advanced features like one-click WordPress installation and free SSL certificates. This simplifies the management of archaeology platform websites and applications.

### Free Website Migration
Migrating an existing archaeology platform to a new hosting provider can be complex. Scala Hosting offers free website migration services, handling the entire process for you to ensure a smooth and hassle-free transition. This is especially helpful if your platform already has a lot of data and a complex setup.

### Pricing

Higher-tier plans offer more resources for larger and more demanding archaeology platforms.
