Scala Hosting is best known for its managed VPS hosting.

It offers similar functionality, including website management, email account setup, database management, and file management, but with a modern interface and improved performance. A notable advantage is that SPanel is free for Scala Hosting customers, whereas cPanel licenses can add significant costs.

### Security Features
Security is a top priority for Scala Hosting. They offer real-time server monitoring, proactive malware scanning, and automated backups to keep your website safe and secure. Their SShield security system actively blocks 99.998% of web attacks, providing an extra layer of protection.
