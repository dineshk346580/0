Their managed VPS plans also include proactive monitoring and server maintenance, so you can focus on your photography.

They also offer free SSL certificates and daily backups to ensure your data is safe and secure.

### Subheading 4: Free Website Migration
If you're already hosting your photography gallery elsewhere, Scala Hosting offers free website migration services. Their team of experts will handle the entire migration process for you, ensuring a smooth and seamless transition to their platform. This can save you a lot of time and effort, especially if you have a large and complex website.

### Subheading 5: Pricing
Scala Hosting's managed VPS plans start at around $14.95 per month (promotional pricing, regular pricing may vary). While this is more expensive than shared hosting, the increased performance, security, and control are well worth the investment for serious photographers. They also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try their service risk-free.
